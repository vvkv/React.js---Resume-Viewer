# React.js---Resume-Viewer
This is the second project in the series of React projects I am working on. The goal of this project was to have the ability to modify the contents of a website (the resume website) by simple modifying the contents of the JSON file. The advantage of this project is that it allows one to create a template that can be updated entirely using only the JSON file. I use www.styleshout.com for the resume template. This project does require node.js and Node Package Modules (NPM) as I use it to create the react app. Installation instructions for NPM are on the facebook.github.io/react page.
The entire project has been zipped and uploaded.
I have also pushed the src folder, just for quick viewing without the need to download and navigate through the entire folder
